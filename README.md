# Kuroba Experimental (Temp name)

KurobaEx is a fast Android app for browsing imageboards, such as 4chan and 8chan. It's a fork of Kuroba. This fork provides lots of new features:

- New technological stack (Kotlin, RxJava/Coroutines, Room etc).

- On demand content loading (includes prefetching, youtube videos titles and durations fetching, inlined files size fetching etc).

- Third-party archives support.

- New thread navigation (tabs).

- New in-app navigation (bottom nav bar).

- New bookmarks (they were fully rewritten from scratch, now use way less memory, don't use wakelocks, show separate notifications per thread (and notifications can be swiped away).

- Edge-to-edge theme support.

- New database.

- 4chan global search support.

- Fully dynamic themes with Android Q Day/Night switch support.

- Lots of other tiny improvements.
