* New technological stack (Kotlin, RxJava/Coroutines, Room etc).
* On demand content loading (includes prefetching, youtube videos titles and durations fetching, inlined files size fetching etc).
* Third-party archives support.
* New thread navigation (tabs).
* New in-app navigation (bottom nav bar).
* New bookmarks (they were fully rewritten from scratch, now use way less memory, don't use wakelocks, show separate notifications per thread (and notifications can be swiped away).
* Edge-to-edge theme support.
* New database.
* 4chan global search support.
* Lots of other tiny improvements.
