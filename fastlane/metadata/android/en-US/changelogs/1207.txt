v0.12.7
TLDR version:
!!! The very first application start may take some time (10-45 seconds) due to disk cache changes (some files need to be moved) !!!
- Android 12 support.
- Navigation history reworked.
- Jetpack Compose screens performance improvements.
- Application startup time improvements.
- Composite catalogs.
- New video player support (mpv).

Full version:
- Post shift comment improvements. When using right alignment of post thumbnails, if the first N lines of a post comment fit the area between the left side of a post and the left side of a thumbnail then the comment will be shifted upwards by that exact offset. In the previous versions, the comment would ever be shifted upwards if all N first lines of the comment fit the area (where N is the amount of lines that fit the amount of pixels calculated by this formula: pixels = thumbnailHeightPx - titleHeightPx - imageFileNameHeightPx - iconsHeightPx). From now on the comment will still be shifted upwards even if only the first line fits. Basically this means that having thumbnails on the right side of the post will now give the most compact post layout possible when combined together with post comment shift setting. Post thumbnails on the right side of the post is now the default setting state.
- Add "Reset" button to all input based settings.
- Some 4chan captcha adjustments with possible fix for the "Standalone coroutine was canceled" bug.
- Some people were experiencing issues when trying to pick a file via file picker or selecting the root directory for media downloads. This was most likely caused by "Don't keep activities" developer setting. Now you will be warned if the setting is turned on. You are not supposed to use it and it often breaks some stuff.
- Fix ANR when downloading mpv libraries from Github.
- Do not download and cache on the disk media files that have unexpected content type (like text/html when the expected one is image/* or video/*). Some sites are using anti-spam checks and until you pass them you will be served only the html page with the scripts or something similar. Some sites even go as far as serving that page when requesting media files. In the previous versions we would always download and cache those pages (while expecting them to be media files) and then silently crash in the media viewer when trying to load those files. Now they won't be downloaded at all.

v0.12.6
- Fix some mpv crashes.
- Update themes in the theme gallery repository.
- Fix a bug where navigation history would not be deleted automatically when deleting a bookmark with navigation history disabled.

v0.12.5
- Fix a crash that happens when playing the post blink animation when navigating to a post via search/replies popup windows with animations globally disabled in the developer settings.

v0.12.4
- KurobaEx now supports mpv. It's distributed as a downloadable plugin to decrease the apk size. By default ExoPlayer is enabled just like before. If you never had problems with the video playback then you most likely don't even need to use mpv. This is mostly for people using phones with buggy hardware decoders. To enable mpv instead of ExoPlayer you need to go to Settings -> Plugins then enable mpv and install the libraries by clicking the "Mpv libraries status". There are two options for libraries installation:
1. Just use the pre-built ones from Github. This is the "just works" option but it's not allowed for FDroid builds because FDroid prohibits using pre-built libraries. 
2. Install libraries locally from a directory. This is an option for people who want to build the libraries themselves and also the only option for people using FDroid builds. You actually don't need to build the libraries by yourself, you can use the same pre-built libraries from the Github. You can find them here https://github.com/K1rakishou/KurobaEx-mpv-libs/releases
Right now mpv doesn't support disk caching at all. It also doesn't support playing videos on hidden boards (like some 2ch.hk boards).

- Fix HistoryNavigationManager getting cleared upon app start when the app goes to background before HistoryNavigationManager is initialized.
- Add ability to scroll to catalog post by long tapping the go to post button when using search.
- Some crash fixes.

v0.12.3
- Composite catalogs. This feature allows you to combine multiple boards (2-10 boards) into a single catalog which can then be loaded like a regular catalog (like the archive catalogs with unlimited amount of pages but in composite catalogs the amount of pages is the amount of added boards). It's also possible to fully load composite catalog without having to scroll down until the last board of the composite catalog (Three dots menu -> Load the rest of this composite catalog). Only non-archive sites can be used in composite catalogs.
- Add LIST view mode for navigation history.
- Periodically update PostCell's title to update the time if it's set to relative time.
- Fix snackbar appearing below the bottom nav view on Android API < Q.
- Fix a crash when opening ReportProblemLayout with a very huge logcat log (unable to create layer for ColorizableEditText).
- Other minor fixes.

v0.12.2
- Fix crash when updating apk.

v0.12.1
- More improvements for the navigation history list.
- Add ability to export/import filters.
- Fix a bug where full image would be hidden a error is occurred while trying to zoom in into the image.
- Fix a bug where Android 10 gesture exclusion zones would randomly get reset.
- Fix PopupControllerContainer and BoardArchiveController when using SPLIT layout mode.

v0.12.0
- Navigation history has been reworked. Now it's possible to pin/unpin navigation history elements (boards/threads) for quick access.
- Add an option to mark already visited threads in the catalog. They will appear more transparent in the catalog. Enabled by default (disable by searching for "Mark already seen threads" in the settings).
- Add compact mode for multi image posts (omit all images except the first one + ability to display omitted images). Enabled by default (disable by searching for "Post multiple images compact mode" in the settings).
- Posts marked as yours are now marked differently. Instead of changing whole post background, your posts are now marked with a line on the left side of the post and replies to your posts are marked with dotted line. The line uses "post_saved_reply_color" color which was currently updated for the two default themes but not for the rest. You will probably have to update it manually if you are using a custom theme or wait when github themes are updated (which should happen by the next release).
- Migrate crashlogs, anrs, file_chunks_cache, filecache directories from the Android cache directory to files directory. The reason for this migration is that sometimes Android may start cleaning up the app's cache directory even when the app is running (and even if the device has enough of disk space) which breaks everything related to CacheHandler until app restart. We don't want this to happen so from now on all the cached files will be located in the "files" directory. To clear app's disk caches (media and exoplayer) there is a button in the developer settings (application's developer settings not Android's). This weird Android behavior was one of the reasons of the bug where images sometimes would stop loading until app restart.
- Add an option to export downloaded threads media into a backup (this may make backups very large).
- Decrease min and default disk caches size.
- Fix deleted posts in threads not being marked as deleted in threads.
- Add "open media by url" option.
- Fix CommentSpanUpdater incorrectly updating link spans.
- Fix incorrect parsing of "<br />" tags on Lainchan.
- Always show last posting error in the reply layout when opening it until: 1. The user swipes away the notification. 2. The user clicks the reply layout error message.
- Fix catalog not showing any threads after full catalog reload when in airplane mode (no internet).
- Track thread status (Closed/Archived/Deleted/Pinned/Unpinned) and display it to the user (snackbar). Track deleted thread posts and display them to the user (snackbar). Add ability to mark deleted posts on the scrollbar.
- Some adjustments for post comment shift + fix huge bottom offset of snackbar in SPLIT layout mode.
- Fix not being able to disable filters one by one.
- Enabling/disabling filters now uses memory cache to reload posts instead of reloading them from the server.
- Move loadLogs() to a background thread.
- Add ability to mark selected bookmarks as read.
- Try to figure out the posting timeout and wait before sending a reply if a board has the cooldown info. Should fix the bug when the captcha is required to be solved twice when posting more than once sequentially.
- Remove ability to hide 4chan captcha background (wasn't really that useful, lots of people got confused by it).
- Fix a crash when opening media in threads with tons of media (1000+ images).
