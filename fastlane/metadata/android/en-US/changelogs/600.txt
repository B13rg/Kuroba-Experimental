v0.6.0-beta
TLDR version:
- Beta apks are now built without "debuggable" flag.
- New media downloader.
- Reply layout gestures.
- ANR detection system.
- New 4chan archive (wakarimasen.moe).

Full version:
- ***This is only for BETA apks! Release/F-Droid versions are not affected***. Beta apk are now built as release apks (without the "debuggable" flag) making them more performant. The downside here is that you will have to manually update to version v0.6.0 (or higher) from any version below 0.6.0, meaning you have to uninstall previous version first (Don't forget that you can export full app backup and then import it back after updating).
- Completely rewritten media downloader. Now it allows downloading media completely in background (even while the main app is dead). Allows checking and resolving duplicate images (file name checks), allows re-downloading failed to download images with single click. Lots of settings.
- Add Reply layout gestures (Longtap BottomNavView + swipe up to open, swipe up/down to expand/collapse/close reply layout). Enabled by default, can be disabled in the settings.
- ANR (Application Not Responding) detection system. Works the same way as the crash reporting system. Enabled by default, can be disabled any time. Nothing is sent automatically, you need to do that manually. ANR reports will help fixing application freezes/deadlocks/etc.
- New FastScroller mode: only scroll when FastScroller's thumb is dragged as opposed to scroll-by-touching any part of scrollbar. Should help eliminating accidental scrolls for people with curved screens.
- Increase the default size of all kinds of PostCell thumbnails (both for phones and tablets).
- Add ability to display post comment under PostCell thumbnail when a post has only one thumbnail (Shift post format v2).
- Add support for archive.wakarimasen.moe.
- Adjust some controller view sizes for tablets, making them bigger.
- Fix couple of bugs related to bitmap decoding being interrupted which could result in us storing corrupted images which would always render as "Error" text.
- Fix Bookmark background watcher sometimes getting stopped right after it is started.
- Fix a bug where shared files would always have "shared_file" name.
- Fix backup import/export not handling theme files.
- Fix RangeSettingUpdaterController making it easier to input value via keyboard.
- Fix reply attach files sometimes disappearing when any exception occurs during post data upload.
- Fix a bug where PostCell thumbnail would have an image of a lower resolution than the size of thumbnail itself when high resolution setting is turned on. 
- Fix filter watching and navigation history conflicts, where threads bookmarked by filter watches could replace the top of the navigation history which then could lead to wrong thread being restored upon app start.
- Fix image viewer getting stuck with no video controls if the image viewer fullscreen mode is disabled and the last time any image was opened we were in the fullscreen mode. 
- Fix a bug where it was impossible to pick files via some file pickers.
- Fix couple of places that could lead to deadlocks.
- Other minor fixes and adjustments.
