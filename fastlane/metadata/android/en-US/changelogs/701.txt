v0.7.1-beta
TLDR version:
- Post view changes and optimizations.
- Previewable threads/posts/archive posts.
- Floating menus updated.
- Dialogs reworked.

Full version:
- Add ability to append thread subject to the result download directory path.
- Add ability to store both images (the previous one and the new duplicate one) by adding the duplicate index to the new image (e.g. "image_(1).jpg").
- Fix keyboard getting automatically hidden when searching for something or when writing a reply in a thread.

v0.7.0-beta:
- Added a setting to change post view thumbnail size (can be found in Appearance settings).
- Post view comment selection now starts by double clicking a post, not long clicking it. (Thanks to Dashchan project for the idea of how to make this work).
- Post menu can now be shown by long clicking a post. The three dot button was removed.
- Post thumbnails were reworked. They can now be shown on the left or right side of posts (there is a separate setting for catalog/thread posts, it's called "Post alignment mode").
- New layout for thumbnail container when a post has multiple thumbnails.
- Lots of stuff that was calculated during post bind stage was moved to an earlier stage to make post binding faster. This should make the catalog/thread scrolling more smooth.
- External thread/external post/catalog thread/dead post/archive post links can now be previewed.
- FloatingListMenu will now appear closer to the touch position.
- Prefetching now works correctly when it's enabled together with high-res cells setting. It also now works in albums.
- Can now long click links to show link menu.
- ImageSaver now uses a separate instance of FileManager so it shouldn't slow down disk access speed for the rest of the application when a lot of stuff is being downloaded.
- Dialogs have been reworked and now don't use the Window instances. Should no longer have strange ugly artifacts around them.
- Add ability to reorder BottomNavView's buttons.
- Other minor fixes and adjustments.
