v0.9.5-release
TLDR version:
- Media viewer rewritten from scratch.
- Media viewer updated gestures.
- Theme gallery.
- New post thumbnail scaling type.
- New site support (370chan.info).

Full version:
- Remove EventBus dependency.
- Fix a bug where media viewer would not be closed, but closing (fade out) animation will be played to the end which made it seem that the app became frozen when in reality it's the media viewer still not closed, blocking the rest of the UI. This happened when "download" media viewer action is selected as the bottom media viewer action.
- Update FDroid screenshots.

v0.9.4-release
- Only show "Go to post" media viewer toolbar button if media viewer was opened from an album.
- Add ability to change media viewer gesture actions. 
- Add "Open album" action. 
- Add ability to view catalog albums.
- Fix "share media content" sharing files without the file extension.
- Fix conflicts when using Android 10 system back gesture on top of the fast scroller when in thread which led to fast scroller getting stuck in the "dragging" state.
- Add board selection to 4chan global search.
- Adjust navigation history item views' width on tablets.

v0.9.3-release
- Some adjustments for where to show the media actions (they were hardcoded before, now they appear around the initial touch position).
- Fix media viewer's close button sometimes having gray tint.
- Fix a small part of thumbnail container being visible when a post has only one image.
- Do not show "Navigate" notification action on Android 9 and below because Android's DocumentsUI application is broken there.

v0.9.2-beta
- Fix for transparent images staying transparent even with "Allow image transparency" setting disabled.
- Reply attach files can now be viewed in the new media viewer (can be accessed by going to media reencode options and then clicking the media).
- Implement "SaveAsDuplicate" option for ResolveDuplicateImages controller. When selected, the image will be saved again but with a different name (For example "image.jpg" will be saved as "image_(1).jpg").
- Can now view media in the ResolveDuplicateImages controller in the new media viewer.
- Add checks to prevent drawing very huge gifs that crash the app.
- Gesture exclusion zones now work in the new media viewer.
- Fix boards sometimes getting seemingly randomly sorted (which usually causes /trash/ to be the first board of the list instead of /3/ on 4chan).
- Adjust sorting algorithm when searching for boards by their name. Now boards that match the query should be at the beginning of the list.
- Fix some rare NPEs.

v0.9.1-beta
- Fix a crash when opening media viewer with media prefetching setting turned on.

v0.9.0-beta
- Media viewer has been rewritten from scratch. The main problem with the old one was that all the logic related to displaying media was too tightly coupled together (the MultiImageView class) which lead to some nasty bugs. The other problem was that it was using the main activity which lead to a bug that was present since the very first release. The bug happened when the media viewer was going into fullscreen mode which doesn't work together with edge-to-edge on Android 9 and below. It would cause all subsequent animations and layout passes to be completely broken. The bug was "fixed" by using different fullscreen mode flags in Android version 9 and below and Android 10 and above (where everything was working as intended). Basically it was a very weird Android bug. Now media viewer exists in a separate activity. The other goal of this was to make ExoPlayer (which is used to play video/audio) reusable so we don't have to create and destroy it on every view pager swipe. There are bugs on some phones where calling ExoPlayer.release() may hang the app for quite some time. And since release() is called after every swipe it may become almost impossible to use the app.
- Media viewer gestures were slightly changed. Now you can close the viewer by swiping the media in any direction. To download it you need to tap it and continue moving the finger without stopping it will show you two options: download or close. There are also now options when longtapping the media.
- Theme gallery is finally implemented. Themes from the main github repository were moved into it's own repository https://github.com/K1rakishou/KurobaEx-themes which is used by the theme gallery. Basically you can now add your themes to that repository and everybody will be able to use them (There are some rules so first read the repository's README before sending Tomorrow clones). To access the gallery you need to go to the theme settings and then click "More themes". They are separated by the light/dark type.
- The app can now detect theme json in post comments to make it possible to apply them by longtapping the posts and selecting "Apply theme %THEME_NAME%" menu.
- New scaling type was introduced for post thumbnails: "Fit Center". Basically it will try to fit the whole image inside the thumbnail while trying to preserve the original aspect ratio. This is turned on by default and can be disabled in the Post settings (Search for Post thumbnail scaling type and change it to "Center Crop").
- When using "Fit Center" scaling type a black background will be drawn behind the thumbnail. You can disable it in the same place (Post settings, search for "Draw black background behind post thumbnails").
- Themes can now be exported to clipboard.
- Added "Open thread in archive and scroll to selected post" and "Preview post in archive" menu options.
- Fixed couple of IndexOutOfBounds exceptions when inserting tags into post comment.
- Fix a bug where a thread would always be fully re-parsed a second time (on the next thread update) after opening it. This could lead to app freezes when opening very huge threads (5k+ posts).
- Added support for 370chan.info site (Thanks to @alcharkov).
