v0.4.0-beta

Important! Due to a possibility of a really nasty bug happening all site settings have been reset
to defaults (captcha type/passcode/pol flag/etc.). Unfortunately, you will have to re-enter them
manually.

- TargetSdk 30. For people using Android 10 and below nothing should change.
But if you are already using Android 11 then you will notice that you can't use "Java File API"
anymore when selecting a directory for downloaded files and can only use SAF API.
This is due to Android limitation and new Scoped Storage feature which is forced upon everyone and
there is no way to avoid it. You will probably also notice that all file operations
(like downloading multiple files) are now slow as hell. This is because of SAF/Scope Storage too.
Say your thanks too Google for this wonderful "feature".
- New reply layout attach files section. It is now possible to attach multiple files per post
(depends on site). It is now possible to share external media into the app (including sharing media
via keyboard).
- (2ch.hk) It's now possible to load passcode information (like max allowed images per post or
max total file size per post) which will be used to figure out whether you can post or not.
To do that you need to click "Refresh posting limits info" after logging in with your passcode.
If you ever change your passcode you will have to refresh it that again.
- When selecting an external file picker it will now be remembered (you can change it by long
pressing the "Attach new file" button and selecting a different file picker).
- Fix a bug where a theme is not applied on app start if "Ignore system Day/Night mode" is disabled.
- Add interval setting for foreground thread watcher (also add a setting to enable/disable adaptive
foreground thread info refresh interval).
- Add BigTextStyle notification style for reply notifications (when there is currently only one
active reply notification).
- Images of hidden/removed posts will not show up in image viewer/gallery anymore.
- Site settings were extracted into their own separate files to avoid nasty bugs where two settings
for different sites could have the same name.
- Chunked downloading setting can now be applied separately for each site (including archives).
- It's now possible to hide thread history in the drawer and only leave bookmarks or vice versa.
- Release builds can now show logs (When "Verbose logs" setting is enabled).
- Add ability to manually set thread posts cap (it's more like a debug setting but you can
use it too for threads with thousands of replies that are not rolling sticky threads).
- Fix a bug where current scroll position was not saved after using fast scroller.

The toolbar search is still broken is will be fixed in v0.4.1 (or later)

v0.4.1-beta

- Fix a crash that is caused by wrong Context object used for dialogs creation in UpdateManager.
