v1.1.0
TLDR version:
- Custom bookmark groups.

Full version:
- Custom bookmark groups. It's now possible to create custom bookmark groups and move bookmarks into them. To access bookmark groups go to the bookmarks screen -> threedot menu -> Bookmark groups settings. Since moving bookmarks into groups manually may become really tedious it's now also possible to assign a bookmark group matcher (basically one or more regex patterns, 8 maximum) to a bookmark group and all bookmarks matching that pattern will be automatically moved into that group upon bookmark creation (the only exception is bookmarks created by filter watcher which will be moved into a group named by the filter pattern). The matchers work similarly to how filters work currently. The only difference is you can combine multiple patterns with AND or OR operators to create complex matchers. For example you can create a matcher that will be looking for "/vn/" pattern in thread subject OR thread comment and if it finds it there then the bookmark will be automatically moved into the group associated with those matchers. By default groups are pre-created for all sites (the matcher pattern is Site name), because that's how it's been in the previous versions (bookmark group == site name). Disabled sites will have no matcher and will be marked with "!" icon. You can safely delete them and other groups that you don't use. Additionally, FilterWatches screen has been removed since Bookmarks screen can now do exactly the same thing. To learn more about bookmark group matchers you can read the help message that can be found in the Bookmark groups settings screen.
- Fix a bug in post highlight filter system where we would never highlight the actual keyword in the posts because of an incorrect check.
- Make asyncPostCellDataCalculation enabled by default and remove the setting.
- Add sys.4channel.org and find.4channel.org into respondsTo method. This fixes proxies not working for requests (more specific the reply request) on 4channel boards.
- Fix some crashes caused by Jetpack Compose bug.
- Fix iframe tag parsing, add support for parsing of escaped html tag attributes (stuff like <iframe width=\"560\"/> instead of <iframe width="560"/>).
- Fix filter pattern compilation when it has an empty space at the end (and probably at the beginning) of it. Consider it an empty pattern if it only consists of whitespaces.
