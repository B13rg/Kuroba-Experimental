v0.10.0-beta
- Thread downloader is back. It's also now possible to export downloaded threads as HTML pages with all the downloaded media.

- 2ch.hk partial support for API V2. For now only incremental thread update endpoint is supported.
- 2ch.hk global search support added.
- 2ch.hk dvach captcha support added.
- Media viewer Close/Download actions won't be shown anymore when zoomed into an image.
- ReplyLayout's attach media item's height slightly decreased.
- Enable gzip encoding for all network requests.
- Themes updated. New color was added "back_color_secondary" which is used for elements drawn on top of elements that use "back_color" (pretty much all background elements).
- It's now possible to view all replies or posts marked as own in the same place.
- It's now possible again to access built-in 4chan archive.
